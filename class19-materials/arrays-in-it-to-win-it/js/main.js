//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["scarface", "braveheard", "stuck on you"]
alert(movies)
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let best = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let long = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
